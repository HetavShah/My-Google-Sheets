Hi, This is  Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets Clone with All the Basic Text Editing Features . 

1) You Can Perform Text formatting on Single Cells As well as multiple Cells

2) For selecting multiple Cells U can Press Ctrl Key And then Select The starting Address And Ending Address

3) You Can also Provide Cell Address in Address Bar . If Your Address is Correct then Address Bar will select that cell . otherwise it will point to the previous correct 
address.

4) You can Perform Basic Arithmatic Operations in the Formula Bar . All operators and Operands must be space seperated ( i.e A1 + A2 - 2 * A3 + A4 )

5) Available Built-in  Formulas : = SUM ( Exp1 , Ex2 ) , = SUB ( Exp1 , Exp2 ) , = MUL ( Exp1 , Exp 2) , = INTERPOLATE ( Value , CellRange1 , CellRange2 ) 

6) You can add Chart by Clicking on Chart Button. There are Only 2 Charts Available which are bar and line  (Case Sensitive) . Any other option or Wrong Input will Not
Create The Chart .

7) You can delete the created Chart by Right clicking on it . 

8) You can add more sheets by clicking Add Sheets Button In the Bottom Left Corner. 

9) If u want to Deselect the cells U can Hold The ctrl Key and press any other location and then release the ctrl key and select any other cell.


// KNOWN ISSUES

-> Not Fully Responsive . ( It would be a great help if anyone want to contribute to its responsiveness)

-> Charts Are Created On the Top of The Screen . So they can be dragged anywhere on the screen

-> Creating more then one charts and Deleting The Previous chart is creating an issue with other charts ( Not sure why it is happening but i am looking into it )

-> Downloading a sheet only downloads the sheets and not charts ( because that's how I coded that logic )

-> You can't copy paste a single Cell . U need to press Twice on the cell  ( That's because the code is getting only starting address if u click the cell one time so in order to provide ending address you need to click once more .


// FUTURE PLANS 

-> Fixing Known Issues

-> Providing Graph Functionality with Desmos API.

-> Providing Recursive Support in Built-in Formulas

-> adding More type of Charts with More features

-> Providing Dynamic Updation of Charts
